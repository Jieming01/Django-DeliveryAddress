# Django-DeliveryAddressForm

Welcome to my restaurant delivery form project! This project provides a simple way for customers to input their delivery details when placing orders for food delivery from Carne Texas Bar&Grill restaurant. The project allows customers to add and remove their delivery address information by using HTML for the user interface and Django Python for handling the server-side logic.
